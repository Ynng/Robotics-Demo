# Robotics demo

Robot simulator for FRC to teach control theory.

#### Things this project was made to teach:
* Limitations of naive PID controllers
* The effect of each term in the PID controller.
* Integral windup
* Different types of PID (position vs velocity)

#### TODO:
* [x] Drivetrain (Position PID)
* [x] Lift (Position PID, constant force needed)
* [ ] Flywheel (Velocity PID)
* [ ] 2D drivetrain?

## Getting Started
1. Download the latest build [here](https://github.com/Ynng/Robotics-Demo/releases/latest). (`Build.zip` under the `Assets` dropdown)
2. Unzip `Build.zip`, run `Robotics Demo.exe`
3. Tune PID Controllers and see what happens.
